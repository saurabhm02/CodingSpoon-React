## Overview

This code repository contains a React application with components related to routing, error boundaries, lazy loading, and charting. The primary components include:

- **Routing**
  - Handles navigation within the application using React Router.
  - Utilizes code splitting for lazy loading of components.
  - Defines routes for various pages such as home, about, login, signup, and charts.

- **Error Boundary**
  - A higher-order component (HOC) that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its component tree.
  - Displays an error message if an error occurs in the child components.
  - Logs error details to the console.

- **Lazy Loading**
  - Demonstrates lazy loading of components using React's \`lazy\` function and the \`Suspense\` component.
  - Implements a simple counter that throws an error if the count exceeds 10.
  - Displays a counter and a button to increment the count.

- **Charting**
  - A placeholder for a component related to charting.
  - Currently set to lazy load from the same module as CreatePost (Note: This might be an error in the import statement).
