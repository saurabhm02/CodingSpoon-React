# React Learning Journey - Day 5

Welcome to Day 5 of your React learning journey with Coding Spoon! In today's session, we covered the implementation of a simple multi-page web application using React and React Router. Below, you'll find an overview of the components and features implemented in our project.

## Components

### 1. **App Component**

The `App` component serves as the entry point for the application. It utilizes React Router to define routes and renders different components based on the route.

### 2. **Home Component**

The `Home` component represents the main page of the application. It displays a welcome message and encourages users to log in for a more enriched experience.

### 3. **Login Component**

The `Login` component handles user authentication. It includes form validation, error handling, and responsive design. Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page.

### 4. **NavBar Component**

The `NavBar` component is a navigation bar providing links to different pages, including Home, Child, and GrandChild. It also includes login and signup buttons for easy user navigation.

### 5. **Welcome Component**

The `Welcome` component displays a welcome message after a successful login, inviting users to enjoy their stay on the website.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains individual React components (Home, Login, NavBar, Welcome).
- `src/assets`: Stores image assets used in the application.
- `src/App.js`: Main entry point for the application, defining routes and rendering components.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

Feel free to explore the codebase and make modifications as needed for your project. Happy coding!
