# Node.js File Reading and Promise Example

This repository contains examples of file reading in Node.js using the `fs` module and demonstrates the use of promises and asynchronous functions.

## Topics Covered

### 1. File Reading with fs Module

- Using the Node.js `fs` module to read a file (`data.js`) asynchronously.
- Handling asynchronous file reading using a callback function.
- Logging the file data if reading is successful.

### 2. Promises

- Creating a promise with the `Promise` constructor.
- Logging the resolved data when the promise is fulfilled.
- Handling promise rejection and logging errors.
- Executing code in the `finally` block, regardless of promise resolution.

### 3. Async/Await

- Defining an asynchronous function (`getData`) using the `async/await` syntax.
- Using `await` to resolve a promise inside an async function.
- Handling the result of the async function using `then` method.
